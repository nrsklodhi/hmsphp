capacity building training workshops for staff at all

In monitoring service providers, we are providing an effective
mechanism to monitor the standard of the service provided
(e.g. security services, consultancy services, renovation
services) and prevent compromised staff from conniving at
the service providers' sub-standard work.<br>

<ul class="list-2">
Internal Controls Effective internal controls are achieved through the
following ways :
 
<li>Installed a Closed Circuit Television Systems (CCTV) in
the room where the safe is located and restrict access to
the master key to one person to enhance accountability;</li>
<li>Segregating the duties of cashiering and bank
reconciliation where practicable;</li>
<li> Assigned an independent staff member to conduct surprise
revenue checks, i.e. the cash holdings against the
records maintained at the operating departments to
detect and deter any irregularities;</li>
<li> Scrutinized the authorization of all void and adjusted
bills.</li>
</ul>
